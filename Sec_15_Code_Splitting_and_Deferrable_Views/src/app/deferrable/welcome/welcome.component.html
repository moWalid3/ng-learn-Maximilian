    <h2>Build Web Apps With Angular!</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Angular is one of the most popular modern web development frameworks out
    there!
  </p>
  <p>
    It's getting used by thousands of developers and companies since it allows
    developers to build powerful, highly interactive web applications with ease!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst you could use "just JavaScript" to build such applications, Angular
    vastly simplifies the process and allows you to build applications with a
    clear, modular structure - a feature that's especially important as
    applications become more complex.

  </header>

  <p>
    This course will teach you all the fundamentals about components, templates,
    directives, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a
    lot of deep dives and build multiple demo projects along the way. All
    examples showcase the features Angular offers and how to apply them
    correctly.
  </p>

  <p>Best of all? This course doesn't stop at the basics!</p>

  <p>
    We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into Angular as well as
    TypeScript concepts which are especially important for Angular developers!

<!-- 
  - don't use @defer with startup page or anything that doesn't replaced
  - else if you need make it **> on viewport or interaction ... ==> ok that make sense so do it it's allow 
-->

<!--
  ! make code load lazily
  * on viewport     ==> while you scroll to it when you arrive to it => then start load or work
  * on interaction  ==> while you click on @placeholder content => it's not display until you click on placeholder content

  * on interaction; prefetch on hover ==> prefetch on hover or on any event else 
      ==> it means => make the defer content (timer component) load fast when you hover on placeholder content 
        but don't show it or make it work until he click on placeholder content and to understand it look at network it works when you
        hover on placeholder but don't show defer until you click
-->

@defer (on interaction; prefetch on hover) {
  <app-offer-preview />
} @placeholder {
  <!-- it's display while the component is bing loaded -->
  <!-- <p>We might have an offer!!</p> -->

  <p class="text-center">click me to show the timer component</p>
}



<!-- => a good example by interaction with template reference variable -->
<button type="button" #greeting>Hello!</button>
@defer (on interaction(greeting)) {
  <app-offer-preview />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Calendar placeholder</div>
}

<!-- => @loading , @error -->
@defer {
  <app-offer-preview />
} @loading (after 100ms; minimum 1s) {
  <img alt="loading..." src="loading.gif" />
} @error {
  <p>Failed to load the calendar</p>
